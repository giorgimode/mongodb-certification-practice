For this problem, we have used a subset of the data you previously used in zips.json, not the full set. For this set, there are only 200 documents (and 200 zip codes), and all of them are in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and California.
You can download the handout and perform your analysis on your machine with
mongoimport --drop -d test -c zips small_zips.json
Note

This is raw data from the United States Postal Service. If you notice that while importing, there are a few duplicates fear not, this is expected and will not affect your answer.
